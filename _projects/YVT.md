## Project Overview üåü

**YouTube Volume Transition** is a browser extension designed to enhance your YouTube experience by ensuring smooth volume transitions between videos. No more abrupt volume changes that catch you off guard! This extension features include smooth transitions, a user-friendly interface, and customizable settings for optimal user experience.
