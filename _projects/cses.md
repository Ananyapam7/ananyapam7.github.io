## About CSES Problem Set

The CSES (Coding Skills Enhancement Set) Problem Set is a collection of competitive programming problems designed to offer challenges for both beginners and experienced programmers. It covers a wide range of topics in algorithms and data structures, making it a great resource for learning and teaching competitive programming and algorithmic thinking.

## Problem Categories

The CSES Problem Set is divided into various categories, each focusing on a different aspect of algorithmic problem solving. These include:

1. **Introductory Problems:** Basic problems to get started with the problem set.
2. **Sorting and Searching:** Problems involving sorting algorithms, searching techniques, and related concepts.
3. **Dynamic Programming:** Challenges that require understanding and application of dynamic programming techniques.
4. **Graph Algorithms:** Problems based on graph theory, including traversal, shortest paths, and network flow.
5. **Range Queries:** Problems that involve processing and answering queries on ranges of data.
6. **Mathematics:** Problems that require knowledge of mathematical concepts like number theory, combinatorics, and probability theory.
7. **String Algorithms:** Challenges involving string processing and manipulation.
8. **Geometry:** Problems based on geometric concepts and computational geometry.
9. **Advanced Techniques:** More complex problems that combine multiple algorithms and data structures.
