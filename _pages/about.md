Did you know the entire mathematics would topple without using Ïƒ-algebras to define probability theory? Something a statistician might not use everyday while working but subtly appreciates at the back of his mind :)

A statistician by major, programmer by passion, and a researcher at heart. As someone who's been fascinated by mathematics since childhood, I'm thrilled to have pursued it as my major. The subject's perfect blend of rigour and versatility makes it fulfilling to study and enjoyable to work with. Though I have a keen interest in computational biology, particularly genetics and network-neuroscience, where I find amazing similarities with computer science (my minor). I've also had the privilege of studying physics in my institute, and I continue to be enthralled by ideas from quantum physics and their applications in quantum computation as well as finance.

I've explored several diverse fields, but I've now decided to focus on and strengthen my skills in a few select subjects which include Statistics and Machine Intelligence and improving my knowledge in C++ and Python.
