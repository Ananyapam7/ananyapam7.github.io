Did you know the entire mathematics would topple without using Ïƒ-algebras to define probability theory? Something a statistician might not use everyday while working but subtly appreciates at the back of his mind :)

A statistician by major, programmer by passion, and a researcher at heart. As someone who's been fascinated by mathematics since childhood, I'm thrilled to have pursued it as my major at IISER Kolkata. The subject's perfect blend of rigour and versatility made it satisfying to study and built my foundations in Statistics and Mathematics. My enthusiasm for programming led me to complement my studies with a minor in the Computational and Data Sciences. I completed my MS Thesis at MPI-NAT where I worked on Variational Inference to speed up alternate MCMC approaches.

After joining IIT Bombay as a Pre-Doctoral student, I got the opportunity to extensively learn about Operating Systems, Microprocessors like the 8086 and Computer Networks, along with my working on my primary research in Statistical Machine Learning. I have decent knowledge in C++ and Python. Next stop: PhD?
