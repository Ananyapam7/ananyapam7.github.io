I'm currently a Pre-Doctoral fellow at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay under Prof. Sharat Chandran. My journey in academia has been fueled by my passion for Statistics and Programming, alongside a deep-rooted interest in research.

My academic background is grounded in Statistics and Mathematics, which I majored in at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata. This experience laid the foundation for my career, combining my love for mathematics and an enthusiasm for programming. I further specialized with a minor in Computational and Data Sciences. My time at the Max Planck Institute for Natural Sciences (MPI-NAT) under Dr. Johannes Soeding was transformative, where my Master's thesis on Variational Inference significantly shaped my research interests in the areas of Probabilistic ML, Approximate Inference, MCMC and Optimization.

At IIT Bombay, my expertise has broadened to encompass Operating Systems, Microprocessors, and Computer Networks, while also advancing my research in Statistical Machine Learning. I am decent experience in C++, Python, and Problem Solving. 

Off duty you'll find me playing TT, chess, football or strumming my uke. 

Next stop: PhD?
