  - title: "Deep Item Response Theory"

    description: "Deep Item Response Theory (Deep IRT) is an extension of the traditional IRT which is used to analyze the properties of tests and items in educational assessments, focusing on the relationship between the latent traits of individuals and their item responses. Deep IRT takes this further by employing deep learning techniques like attention to model complex non-linear relationships between items and latent traits."

  - title: "Variational Inference"
    thumbnail: ../assets/img/vi.png
    description: "Variational Inference offers an alternative to MCMC for approximating complex posterior distributions. This was an introductory talk introducing the basics of VI and how the seminal paper on Stochastic Variational Inference helped make VI faster and scalable."
