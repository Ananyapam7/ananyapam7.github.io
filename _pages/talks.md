    date: 11 September 2023, IIT-Bombay
    description: "Deep Item Response Theory (Deep IRT) is an extension of the traditional IRT which is used to analyze the properties of tests and items in educational assessments, focusing on the relationship between the latent traits of individuals and their item responses. Deep IRT takes this further by employing deep learning techniques like attention to model complex non-linear relationships between items and latent traits."
