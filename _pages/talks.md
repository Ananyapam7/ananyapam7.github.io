workshops:
  - name: "Summer School on Applied Combinatorics â€“ Cryptography and Combinatorial Topology"
    date: 11 - 23 July 2022, TCG CREST
    description: "The program covered three main areas: 
    Foundations, which focused on combinatorial mathematics, including Polya Theory, Graph Theory, and Number Theory,
    Cryptography, which explored cryptographic methods like Ciphers and Public Key Cryptography, with an introduction to Quantum Computation and Combinatorial Topology exploring the Topological Tverberg Problem and Discrete Morse Theory."

  - name: "Amazon Machine Learning Summer School"
    date: July 2022
    description: "Learnt key topics like Supervised Learning, Deep Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Dimensionality Reduction and advanced topics Probabilistic Graphical Models, Sequential Learning, Causal Inference and Reinforcement Learning."

  - name: "Winter School on Blockchain and Cryptography"
    date: 2 - 27 Dec 2019, IISER Pune
    description: "Conducted an in-depth exploration of Blockchain architecture and Distributed Ledger Technologies, focusing on their applications beyond finance in areas like supply chain, healthcare, and voting systems. This included studying various consensus mechanisms such as proof of work and proof of stake, and analyzing the security aspects of Blockchain 1.0, 2.0, and the Tangle, identifying key vulnerabilities and risks."

talks:
  - title: "Unsupervised Learning"
    thumbnail: ../assets/img/Unsupervised_learning.png
    date: 9 April 2024, St. Stephen's College, DU
    description: "This talk was a part of a workshop at DU. Unsupervised Learning is a class of ML methods for learning unlabelled data. We discussed Latent Variable Models, SVD, PCA, Autoencoders, t-SNE, Variational Inference and K-means clustering"

  - title: "Deep Item Response Theory"
    thumbnail: ../assets/img/deep_irt.png
    date: 11 September 2023, IIT-Bombay
    description: "Deep Item Response Theory (Deep IRT) is an extension of the traditional IRT which is used to analyze the properties of tests and items in educational assessments, focusing on the relationship between the latent traits of individuals and their item responses. Deep IRT takes this further by employing deep learning techniques like attention to model complex non-linear relationships between items and latent traits."
