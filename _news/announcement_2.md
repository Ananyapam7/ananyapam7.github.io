In a rather unexpected turn of events, I recently learned that I was awarded the first prize at the Google Winter of Code 2022 for my work with Skit AI. The news came as quite a surprise, as I was under the impression that the event was more of a collaborative endeavor than a competition. Already engaged in a new project, I hadn't given much thought to the outcome of the Winter of Code.

The revelation arrived with a package of goodies, including T-shirts from Github, Skit AI, GDSC IIIT Kalyani, and some charming stickers, which I've since used to spruce up my laptop.

While expressing my gratitude to the organizers on Discord, I stumbled upon a message from ten days prior about the upcoming announcement of winners. This was news to me, as I had no idea that there were individual recognitions. Driven by curiosity, I watched the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2YGdDCj0qY&t=428s) of the announcement and, to my astonishment, discovered I had secured the top spot!

I made a short [Linkedin post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6949773370745831424/) thanking the organizers soon. While I'm humbled and happy about this recognition, I view it as a testament to the collaborative spirit and learning opportunities that events like the Winter of Code offer, rather than a personal accolade. It's a reminder of the value of engaging in such community-driven projects, where the journey and the experiences gained along the way are as rewarding as any prize.
